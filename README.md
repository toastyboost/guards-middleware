# 🐣 Rollup boilerplate (React, Typescript)

Boilerplate for development and publishing modern React NPM packages or UI-kit modules with Rollup and Typescript.  
Clean and powerfull. Good to fork in your project, learning and development.

It's just work.

## Usage

`yarn build` builds the application to `dist/`  
`yarn lint` check for errors `src/**.ts`

## Rollup features

✅ Bundles CJS and ES module formats  
✅ Compression by Terser  
✅ Aliases  
✅ Sourcemaps

## Boilerplate features

✅ ESLint plugins: Recommended, Typescript Recommended, React, Requiring Types  
✅ Prettier  
✅ No TSLint because he's dead

## TODO

- [ ] Add publishing features
- [ ] Add Badges: CI
- [ ] Add integration with Storybook-boilerplate
